This project exports an org-mode file with reasonably structured items into
a latex file, which compiles into a nice CV. In the same spirit the
org-mode file may export to markdown so that it can be used for a web based
CV.

-   Online documentation in <https://titan-c.gitlab.io/org-cv/>
-   Development happens in the gitlab repository: <https://gitlab.com/Titan-C/org-cv>
-   There is a mirror in github for backup: <https://github.com/Titan-C/org-cv>

This project dog feeds itself and produces the examples on this
documentation page directly.
