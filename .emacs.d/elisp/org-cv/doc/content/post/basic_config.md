You can use org-modes hierarchical structure to describe your CV. To make a
specific subtree an item describing an experience point (Job you have,
degree you pursued, etc.) you use the org properties drawer and with the
`:CV_ENV: cventry` property. You should also include the `FROM` and `TO`
properties defining the span of the event, as `LOCATION` and `EMPLOYER`.

```org
* Employement
** One job
:PROPERTIES:
:CV_ENV: cventry
:FROM:     <2014-09-01>
:TO:     <2017-12-07>
:LOCATION: a city, a country
:EMPLOYER: The employer
:END:

I write about awesome stuff I do.
** Other job
:PROPERTIES:
:CV_ENV: cventry
:FROM:     <2013-09-01>
:TO:     <2014-08-07>
:LOCATION: my city, your country
:EMPLOYER: The other employer
:END:

I write about awesome stuff I do.
