<objective>
Single-terminal command center for managing a milestone. Shows a dashboard of all phases with visual status indicators, recommends optimal next actions, and dispatches work — discuss runs inline, plan/execute run as background agents.

Designed for power users who want to parallelize work across phases from one terminal: discuss a phase while another plans or executes in the background.

**Creates/Updates:**
- No files created directly — dispatches to existing GSD commands via Skill() and background Task agents.
- Reads `.planning/STATE.md`, `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, phase directories for status.

**After:** User exits when done managing, or all phases complete and milestone lifecycle is suggested.

<execution_context>
@$HOME/.config/opencode/get-shit-done/workflows/manager.md
@$HOME/.config/opencode/get-shit-done/references/ui-brand.md
</execution_context>

<context>
No arguments required. Requires an active milestone with ROADMAP.md and STATE.md.

Project context, phase list, dependencies, and recommendations are resolved inside the workflow using `gsd-sdk query init.manager`. No upfront context loading needed.
</context>

<process>
Execute the manager workflow from @$HOME/.config/opencode/get-shit-done/workflows/manager.md end-to-end.
Maintain the dashboard refresh loop until the user exits or all phases complete.
</process>
