# Checks if a command exists, something like 'which' could be used
# instead of 'command -v' but 'which' is non-standard and shellcheck
# will report it as such and will suggest 'command -v'.
#
# This function is mainly used to test for commands with 'it' statements like so:
#     if _command_exists pyenv; then
#         echo "Command exists so do something"
#     fi
installed() {
        command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1
}

# Get the env vars of a running process
# Example: penv docker

       sudo sh -c "tr '\0' '\n' < /proc/$(pgrep "$1")/environ"
}
